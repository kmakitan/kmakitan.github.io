            <p>Fammili is a startup that provides parents with casual weekend activity ideas and assists their weekend decision making process.  I helped design the second Minimum Viable Product which publicly released on the App Store in January.  In addition, I conducted in-person marketing and improved the conversion rates of our sales funnels by updating the website and ads based on learnings from our marketing efforts. Since the team was very small (four people at most) throughout my time there, I ended up doing more than just UX/UI design.</p>

        <div><img class="project-details-image" src=""/></div>
        <p class="text-center body-text"></p>
        <p class="body-text">My first job out of college was at a startup called Fammili.  Fammili was a very small team of four; founder, engineer, marketer, and me - the designer. As the only designer on the team, I had the responsibility of making all the design decisions for the team.  Fammili was an iOS app that let busy parents find family-friendly activities around the Bay Area to do with their kids.  It had an emphasis on casual activities and assisting parents’ decision making process. Fammili was unique because we were creating what we call a Decision Making 2.0 world (think industry 4.0). Instead of users searching for ideas, we took a new approach of matching them (think Tinder). We also followed Lean UX as our core development methodology.</p>

        </div>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">User Interviews</h3>
        <p class="body-text">When I joined the team, we immediately scheduled user interviews to conduct research and figure out our target demographic.  This was the first time I conducted interviews with real people, so it was a test of my problem finding skill. I developed this skill further by conducting interviews, but it's going to be something I am constantly improving throughout my career.</p>
        <h4>Pains</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Holistically busy mentality resulting in thinking they cannot afford more time on weekends for additional activities due to:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Continuous presence of recurring activities</li>
                <li>Busy weekdays</li>
                <li>Miscellaneous mandatory chores and activities taking up time</li>
                <li>Thinking activities will span the whole day when they don’t</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Doing nothing on open weekends, feeling unaccomplished or guilty that there was nothing planned for kids</li>
            <li>Unaware of short duration and easy execution activities</li>
            <li>Falling back to repetitive weekend activities</li>
            <li>Finding activities specific to their age range</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">UX/UI Design</h3>
        <h4>Reference-Based Design</h4>
        <p class="body-text">At Fammili, I refined my reference-based design process. I first took a look at many interfaces created by other designers and grouped them into similar patterns. After that, I would roughly sketch our application using the patterns found and present them for discussion.  Several versions of the selected patterns were then drawn with low to medium fidelity. This was repeated with designs becoming more high-fidelity, until one was chosen.</p>

        <p class="body-text text-center">A hands-on design exercise perfect when more feedback was necessary from people outside the team.</p>
        <h4>Brief User Experience Rundown</h4>
        <p><strong>*Bold experiences are the ones I designed*</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Users like/pass a set of cards (like tinder) to personalize the ideas they receive</li>
            <li><strong>User selects a weekend date, and an activity</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Early Planning: User selects from a couple activities. They also have the option of selecting from mood filters</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Late planning: User can select from a mood they are feeling to have an easier time choosing an activity</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Pass: User can choose to pass on doing an activity that weekend</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <li>User follows the card details and does the activity.</li>
            <li>User reviews the activity, further personalizing their activities</li>
        </ol>

        		<p class="body-text"><strong>Motivating users to plan early</strong> - We found out during our interviews that there are two types of parents - early planners and spontaneous, late planners.  Since we know that there is a higher probability of an activity actually being completed when planned ahead of time, we designed our application to motivate parents to plan early.  We included things like motivational messages, a countdown until the weekend, and any events going on for that day.</p>

       			<p class="body-text"><strong>Late Planning</strong> - We also found that parents often didn’t plan casual activities ahead of time, and instead decided on them spontaneously on the day of. More often than not, parents did routine activities like going to parks or going shopping.  In order to help parents try something different, we created an experience that allowed parents to select from their current mood to find activities that fit how they are feeling.</p>

        <h3 class="project-page-h3">Videos</h3>
        <p class="body-text">Before publicly launching our application, I created an explainer video to get users to understand our concept.  The biggest challenge of creating the explainer video was explaining our concept in less than a minute.  Since most users lose interest in 30 seconds, I had to convey the right information at the right level of detail.  The process took a few weeks to complete, going through pages of scrapped scripts and storyboards.  Creating the videos developed my skill of conveying only the necessary information at the right level of detail.</p>

        <h3 class="project-page-h3">KPI Measurement</h3>
        <p class="body-text">After learning that Fammili would move to Japan after March, my remaining two months became purely for experience. During this time, I helped market the app by conducting both in-person and online marketing.  On the surface, marketing may seem like a detour from UX, however, the brunt of my focus went towards maintaining and improving conversion rates throughout our sales funnels.  I performed daily updates to our ads and ad landing pages, using our in-person marketing as a source to create better content that connects to our users. We made daily judgements on what was the most important issue at hand by reviewing our conversion analytics. By the end of the experience, we talked with over 500 parents and attracted around 1,200 unique visitors to our website.  This yielded a total of around 250 downloads. Aside from assisting our ad and website content, having live interactions with real potential users yielded immediate feedback.</p>

        <h3 class="project-page-h3">Lessons Learned</h3>
        <h4>Connecting Tasks to Improve Efficiency</h4>
        <p class="body-text">I struggled to work effectively in the beginning because I segmented tasks apart from each other.  However, by the end of the project, I learned how to work effectively by using learnings from one task across all other tasks that need to be completed.  Especially when practicing user-centered design, since all of the work is based around the user, a lot of the tasks start to closely relate to each other.</p>
        <h4>Digging Deeper</h4>
        <p class="body-text">Whether it’s asking questions during user interviews, or thinking of phrasing that sparks the interest of your users, this is a very important skill that should be at the core of any designer. Challenging the status quo is something my boss was great at doing. Under his wing, I have learned how difficult, but necessary it is to do this. Admittedly, this is something I am not the best at, but it is something I have learned to do and am continuing to consciously improve.</p>
        <h4>Where I Lie as a Designer</h4>
        <p class="body-text">My time at Fammili became an eye opener during the last week. I self reflected on my experience and learned what I need to improve on, and where I lie as a designer in the real world. I feel more competent, excited, and ready to take on what’s ahead than I have ever felt before.</p>
