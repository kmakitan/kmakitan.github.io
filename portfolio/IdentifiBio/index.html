            <p>In my senior design class at UC Irvine, my team was paired with Identifi Bio - a drug testing company working on digitizing the entire process.  We created a functional prototype of a healthcare application which let users message their physician, upload documents, schedule appointments, and sign documents.  As the UX/UI designer, I designed all of the interfaces, created prototypes, and completed some user research. We also won an award and were invited to the Ingenuity UCI Student Technology Showcase at the end of the year.</p>

        <p class="body-text background-text">All software engineer and informatics student at UC Irvine are required to complete a capstone project during their senior year.  Our professor gathered project sponsors from real companies to pitch their ideas on the first day of class.  We chose to work with the company IdentifiBio, a drug testing startup focused on expediting the process by digitizing.  My team of five split our roles into three developers, one project manager, and one UX/UI designer.</p>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">The Problem</h3>
        <p class="body-text">Dealing with healthcare is annoying.  There’s a ton of paperwork that needs to be done, your interaction with your physician is limited, and requesting appointments is a pain.  In order to solve this problem, we created a prototype that digitized the entire process, making it all available on your phone.  It negates the need for physical copies, creates a more connected relationship with your physician, and allows you to make appointments on the go.</p>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">Identifi Bio Patient Healthcare App</h3>
        <p class="body-text">Identifi Bio is a startup company based in Irvine, CA focusing on digitizing the drug-testing process to make it easier, efficient and more accessible.  In my senior design class, my team of five was paired with them to create a healthcare app.  The app allowed patients to upload and sign documents electronically, make appointments online, and chat with their physician.</p>

        </div>
        
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">1st Quarter Process</h3>
        <p class="body-text">Much of the first half of the quarter was spent getting the project ready by figuring out exactly what we were going to develop, planning our course of action, and documenting important information regarding the project.  After completing most of the preliminary work, we began developing our prototype.</p>
        <h4>Gantt Chart</h4>
        <p class="body-text">We started the process by creating a Gantt chart, which helped us plan and keep track of our assignments throughout the quarter.</p>
        <div><img class="project-details-image" src="images/ganttchart.png"/></div>
        <h4>Communication Plans</h4>
        <p class="body-text">We also created a communication document to establish how often and the method of communication between each other in the group, and with our sponsor.</p>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <p class="body-text">We then immediately started eliciting requirements for the application so we could put down on paper what we were going to build.  We initially settled on the following:</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <strong>Non-functional</strong>
                <p>- Simple and attractive user interface<br></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <strong>Functional</strong>
                <p>- Login system for patients<br>
                    - Uploading documents<br>
                    - Chatting<br>
                    - Viewing test results<br>
                    - Signing Documents</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Use Cases & Use Case Diagram</h4>
        <p class="body-text">After figuring out the functionalities of our product, we had to write use cases to outline all the interacting functionalities of our system. From the list of use cases, we derived a diagram so we could visually see the interactions.</p>
        <div class="project-image-wrapper"><img class="project-details-image" src="images/usecase.png"/></div>
        <h4>Stakeholder Diagram</h4>
        <p class="body-text">We also created a stakeholder diagram to visualize all the people interacting within our system.</p>
        <div class="project-image-wrapper"><img class="project-details-image" src="images/stakeholder.png"/></div>
        <h4>UML Diagram</h4>
        <p class="body-text">A UML diagram visualized the parts of our system that would be interacting with each other.</p>
        <div class="project-image-wrapper"><img class="project-details-image" src="images/uml.png"/></div>
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p class="body-text"><strong>Challenge 1 - Uncooperative developers:</strong> The first challenge our group faced was that the developers of Identifi Bio, which were based in India, were uncooperative in sharing any access to the code for the existing application.  This was very important to our team because without access, we had nothing to base our project from and had to start completely from scratch.  We tried numerous times by asking our sponsor to get us at least API access and even had him join our group conference calls, but all to no avail.  Since there was nothing we could do about their stubbornness, we had to take it as a loss and build our application completely from scratch,  which led us to our second challenge.</p>
        <p class="body-text"><strong>Challenge 2 - Inexperience:</strong> Only one of our developers was familiar with Swift and XCode.  This meant that the other two would have to learn everything, which also meant time taken away from development.  However, this was expected by our professor and the two inexperienced developers worked well together and learned quickly.  But developing in XCode caused another challenge.</p>
        <p class="body-text"><strong>Challenge 3 - Mac Only:</strong> XCode was only available on Macs and none of us had Mac computers to develop on.  We solved the problem temporarily by operating on remotely connected Macs which one of the developer’s workplace was able to provide us.  However, since we only had access to one computer, which was also painfully slow, it meant only one of the three could develop at a time.  Since this was slow and inefficient, we sought for another solution.  We seeked help from our sponsor, and he purchased us two mac laptops to do our development on.  Since we were also all busy with other classwork, two laptops proved to be enough to keep us occupied.  It also meant that we would have to constantly shuffle the laptops around but this was solved by consistent physical meetings.</p>
        <h4>Design Advancements</h4>
        <p class="body-text">For the user interface, I made significant progress designing mockups for each screen. By the end of the quarter, I had completed basic designs of the entire application and also created an interactive prototype in InVision.  Originally, I had planned on using the InVision prototype for user testing with real drug testing patients, but as our project direction changed next quarter, was not able to.</p>

        <h3 class="project-page-h3">2nd Quarter Process</h3>
        <p class="body-text">With all of the documentation and preparation challenges out of the way, we started rapidly developing our prototypes.  Our development was split with the developers working on a coded prototype in XCode and with myself working on the UI prototype.  Over the winter break, our sponsor also changed the project from a drug-testing to healthcare app.  The shift in direction caused nothing more than a few minor changes in the UI designs and documentation, but also ended up causing a challenge.</p>
        <h4>Designing in Figma</h4>
        <p class="body-text">I quickly finalized my designs so I could proceed to prototyping and user testing.</p>
        <iframe class="figma" style="border: none;" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https://www.figma.com/file/fgyHqO9KzZvwR1mZ0MEMQSEL/IdentifiBio-Patient-Mockups?node-id=0%3A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4>Prototyping in Origami Studio</h4>
        <p class="body-text"> I created my prototype in Origami Studio instead of InVision because it allowed me to create highly functional interactions and animations.  This was important so that our developers could understand how to connect the interfaces together.  It would have also simulated a very realistic experience for the user.</p>
        <iframe class="vimeo" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/285579274" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p class="body-text"><strong>Challenge 1 - No Time For Testing:</strong> After completing the prototype, we contacted our sponsor for user testing but we were told that there wouldn’t be enough time to do user testing with his client base.  In addition, the shift of direction in our project also changed our target user from drug testees to healthcare users, which he was not able to connect us to. We ultimately decided to conduct user testing on ourselves since we were starting to run out of time and were met with other challenges.</p>
        <p class="body-text"><strong>Challenge 2 - Infeasible designs:</strong> Inexperience working with XCode prevented the developers from creating user interfaces that looked exactly like the UI designs I had created.  They were complicated and infeasible by the approaching deadline.  I had to go back and change my designs so that it was easier for them to develop.  This also played a factor in preventing us from conducting user testing.</strong></p>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">Result</h3>
        <p class="body-text">In the end, my team was able to complete the project.  We developed all the functionalities of our application and, although separate, designed interfaces that were very well accepted by our sponsor.  Our project was selected among one other in our senior design project class to receive an award and participate in the invitation only Ingenuity UCI Student Technology Showcase at the end of the year.</p>
        <div class="project-image-wrapper"><img class="project-details-image" src="images/ingenuity.png"/></div>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">Lessons Learned</h3>
        <h4>Importance of team cohesiveness</h4>
        <p class="body-text">I learned through this project how important it is for everyone on the team to work well with each other.  In order to get through all of the challenges we faced, we had to communicate well, meet physically, take responsibility of our roles, and help each other out.  Had we not been able to do so, I don’t think we would have been able to submit our completed deliverable in the end, as we saw happen to some of our peer teams.</p>
        <h4>Technical Infeasibility</h4>
        <p class="body-text">When I first designed my designs, I did not take into account how difficult it would actually be to implement. I learned that I need to take into account what my team is actually capable of doing.  In the end, my designs were saved to be recreated later by another team, so it didn’t turn out to be a waste of time and effort.  On top of that, my sponsor hired me as a contract graphic designer for a few weeks after because he really liked them.</p>
