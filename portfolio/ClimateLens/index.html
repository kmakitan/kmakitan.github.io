            <p>In my user interaction software project class, we were tasked with attempting to solve an issue with a technology.  We chose to solve climate change with augmented reality, and created a prototype of our app, Climate Lens.  As the Testing Engineer/UX researcher, my job was to help my team understand the user and ensure that we were developing a product around them.  The aim of climate lens was to provide the user with a surreal experience that was enough to prompt them to take action.</p>

        <div class="project-image-wrapper"><img class="project-details-image" src="images/ClimateLensBG.jpg"/></div>
        <p class="body-text background-text">This class was part of a four-part user interaction course in my major, and I had been looking forward to this series since I switched into Informatics from Computer Science my sophomore year.  All students gave a 30 second elevator pitch including a social/global issue and a type of technology to solve the problem. My team was formed from students who showed interest in climate change and augmented reality.</p>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">The Problem</h3>
        <p class="body-text">Most people are aware and believe that global warming is a real issue.  However, not many are actually taking action to do something about it.  The problem is not lack of awareness anymore, but lack of urgency about climate change.</p>
        <p class="text-center" id="goal">“The bystander effect, or bystander apathy, is a social psychological phenomenon in which individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when other people are present.”</p>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">Climate Lens</h3>
        <p class="body-text">My team of six built a prototype for Climate Lens, an application that provided the user with an immersive experience demonstrating the damage climate change could cause to our planet.  Our team was split into one project manager, two engineers, two designers, and one tester/researcher.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center title CL-page-title">THE PROCESS</h1>
        </div>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">Ideation</h3>
        <p class="body-text">We had our topic and technology set, but we still had to come up with the features we wanted in our app.  We began the process by sketching out example interfaces with pencil and paper, and sharing our drawings with each other.  We decided to visualize the effects of climate change on specific geographical landmarks, depicting weather effects such as desertion and flooding relative to the location.  We also decided that we wanted to provide options for our users that would help them get involved with the cause.</p>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">Lean Canvas</h3>
        <p class="body-text">A lean canvas is an adaptation of the business model canvas, meant for entrepreneurs to break-down ideas into key assumptions.</p>
        <div class="project-image-wrapper"><img class="project-details-image" src="images/LeanCanvas.jpg"/></div>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">Value Proposition</h3>
        <p class="body-text">A value proposition provides three details; relevancy, quantified value, and unique differentiation.<br>
        Relevancy: how the product solve a customer’s problem, or improves their life<br>
        Quantified value: what benefits the product delivers<br>
        Unique differentiation: what makes our product different from our competitors, and why the customer should choose us</p>
        <div class="project-image-wrapper"><img class="project-details-image" src="images/ValueProposition.jpg"/></div>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">Vision Statement</h3>
        <p class="body-text">A vision statement declares what we want to achieve or accomplish.</p>
        <div class="project-image-wrapper"><img class="project-details-image" src="images/VisionStatement.jpg"/></div>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">Research methods</h3>
        <h4>Persona</h4>
        <p class="body-text">I also created a persona to capture and group our target users. Personas helped me understand our target user and build a product around them to satisfy their needs.  It’s important to design around your target user because it will make your product more successful.</p>
        <div class="project-image-wrapper"><img class="project-details-image" src=""/></div>
        <h4>User Journey Map</h4>
        <p class="body-text">In order to convert first-time users to long-term customers, I had to first understand where they were coming from and what they wanted to do.  Creating a journey map of a customer within my product helped align their context and motive to create a flow that helped them get where they wanted to go.</p>
        <div class="project-image-wrapper"><img class="project-details-image" src="images/UserJourneyMap.png"/></div>
        <h4>ERAF Systems Diagram</h4>
        <p class="body-text">This diagram captures the relationships between entities of our system.  I chose to draw this diagram because we have external entities that our system interacts with, and it helps visualize the ecosystem as a whole.</p>
        <div class="project-image-wrapper"><img class="project-details-image" src="images/ERAFSystemsDiagram.png"/></div>
        <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
        <p class="body-text"> I also performed a competitive analysis to gauge how our app would compete with other similar products in the market.  Based on the results, our application is unique in that it centralizes both the AR and call-to-action features to one location.</p>
        <div class="project-image-wrapper"><img class="project-details-image" src="images/companalysis.PNG"/></div>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">User Testing</h3>
        <h4>Cognitive Walkthrough</h4>
        <p class="body-text">in order to make sure we were building an application that was learnable and friendly to new users, I performed a cognitive walkthrough.  After completing the test, despite minor change that would need to be made, it was concluded that our app was friendly to new users.  Most notably because the flow of the experience was fairly linear and we included a set of onboarding screens to get the user familiarized with the app.</p>
        <div class="project-image-wrapper"><img class="project-details-image" src="images/CognitiveWalkthrough.png"/></div>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">Result</h3>
        <h4>Final Prototype</h4>
        <iframe class="invision" height="1000" src="//invis.io/AZN7G3XQ6TY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4>Final Report (53 pages)</h4>
        <div class="button-wrap"><button class="btn"><a href="report/Final Report (ClimateLens).pdf">VIEW REPORT</a></button></div>
        <h3 class="project-page-h3">Lessons Learned</h3>
        <h4>Importance of Research</h4>
        <p class="body-text">Typically when I took on the role of UX, I usually did UI design as well.  However, for the first time, in this class project I solely worked on research.  By focusing my entire attention to research, I learned about all the different methods I could use.  In order to create a product that truly satisfies your user’s goals and delivers a great user experience, user research needs to be conducted extensively and thoroughly.</p>
        <h4>Establish user goals early in the process</h4>
        <p class="body-text">I was always told that goal forming was important to complete at the beginning of the design process, and this redesign project proved it to me.  Establishing a goal in the beginning allowed me to center my entire design around trying to help them achieve it.  It allowed me to relentlessly design for the user and resulted in a design that actually improved the experience.</p>
