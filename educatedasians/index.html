    		<h4>Gameplay</h4>
    		<p>Ring Road Enforcers is a top-down 3D tower defense strategy game created in the Unity game engine.  The game is designed as a tower defense game where the player places towers along a fixed path - Ring Road - to stop enemies from continuing along the path.  However, isntead of towers, the player will station policemen. Likewise, instead of enemies, the player will be defending Ring Road against students who are breaking safety regulations.  The goal of the game is to enforce safety for all UCI student from 9AM to 5PM.</p>

    		<h4>Main Focus</h4>
    		<p>As the main road for the campus, students hope to get from one class to the other safe and sound as they walk through Ring Road.  Under the Transportation and Distribution Services Policies and Procedures, according to Sec. 904-13 Policy C - Prohibited Transportation Devices and Locations, skateboards, roller skates, hoverboards and other skate devices are banned on the UCI Campus Core which includes Ring Road.  However, this policy and other safety policies are infrequently enforced.  The player will be in charge of strengthening the enforcement throughout Ring Road by stationing police to slow down and stop students from breaking these policies by giving them tickets.</p>
