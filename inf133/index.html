            <h1>Research and Testing Behind the Portfolio</h1>
            <h3>User Research - <a class="link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5kOYIcHxC1VcjJRWnBRblJTVFU?usp=sharing">View the user research done for this portfolio</a></h3>
            <p><strong>User Interviews</strong><br>User interviews allow the researcher to get qualitative information from existing or potential users.  Interviews help generate personas that accurately reflect the users.  User interviews helped me shape my website to my target audience.</p>
            <p><strong>Competitor Analysis</strong><br>Competitor analysis helps the researcher understand the strengths and weaknesses of other comparable products in the market.  The analysis provides insight to potential opportunities to take advantage of and threats that need to be accounted for.  Doing a competitor analysis allowed me to see what standards there are for a portfolio and the empty holes I could capitalize on to make mine shine over others.</p>
            <p><strong>Feature Value Matrix</strong><br>A feature value matrix calculates the overall importance of each feature by evaluating it at different values categories.  This matrix helped me filter out exactly which features users would like to see on my website.</p>
            <p><strong>Feature Prioritization</strong><br>Using results from the feature value matrix, a feature prioritization graph visualizes the order of importance of each feature.  This helps create a development timeline to create elements of a product that are most important first.  Prioritizing helped me figure out what was most important and least important to include on my website.</p>
            <h3>User Testing - <a class="link" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w-7wf3bv48Lv83X26Ox26-teUydZJ9mA">View the user testing done for this portfolio</a></h3>
            <p><strong>User Stories</strong><br>User stories are a tool to capture descriptions of a software feature from an end-user perspective.  They help identify if the user is able to achieve their goals.  Filling out this table helped me understand my users and see if they can accomplish what the goals they have when viewing my website.</p>
            <p><strong>Cognitive Walkthrough</strong><br>A cognitive walkthrough is a usability evaluation method in which evaluators work through a series of tasks and ask a set of questions from the perspective of the user which help the researcher evaluate the learnability of the software for new and infrequent users.  Doing a cognitive walkthrough for my website showed me where I needed to improve, such as replacing paragraphs with bullet lists, and helped me redesign so that new users have a better first time experience when visiting my website.</p>
            <p><strong>User Test</strong><br>User testing is a technique used to evaluate a product by testing it on users.  A prototype is typically used for testing.  Testing involves systematic observation and determines how well real users can use the product.  User testing for my website validated the overall structure and design of my portfolio.</p>
            <h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
            <p>Conducting user research helped me to develop a portfolio that was catered and optimal to my users. The user interviews defined my target audience and helped me understand what each different group would like to see on a portfolio.  The competitor analysis opened my eyes to what kinds of portfolios are out there and the standards that are set.  The feature value matrix and feature prioritization allowed me to schedule my development so that I could finish the most important parts first, and the less important sections last.</p>
            <h3>Incorporation of Findings</h3>
            <p><strong>About Me:</strong><br>Replaced about me description with one that shows more personality.</p>
            <p><strong>Experiences Description:</strong><br>Paragraphs are now converted to bullet lists for better readability.  Descriptions also list the skills I have acquired from those jobs</p>
            <p><strong>Project Hover Descriptions:</strong><br>Replaced the tags with short descriptions instead</p>
            <p><strong>Navigation:</strong><br>The navigation was proved unnecessary through user tests for a short one page portfolio.  It will be removed after class ends since it was one of the requirements.</p>
            <p><strong>Resume:</strong><br>Created a button that allows users to download my resume in pdf form.</p>
